# Image for running a CLI agent under test, isolated from the host.
#
# Contains the agent CLI and the cluster tooling a DevOps task needs, and
# deliberately nothing else. The host repo, the operator's home directory, the
# Docker socket and ADC are all absent by construction rather than by policy:
# they are simply not in this image and not mounted by the sandbox wrapper.
#
#   docker build -f hack/agent-sandbox.Dockerfile -t devops-bench/agent-sandbox:dev .
#
# Pin GEMINI_CLI_VERSION / OPENCLAW_VERSION for reproducible runs. Leaving
# either at "latest" means the agent under test changes underneath you between
# runs, which quietly makes results incomparable.
# The base is pinned to the exact Node/Debian the previous image was built on
# (node v22.23.2, Debian 12 bookworm), so a rebuild changes only what the ARGs
# below change. A floating `node:22-slim` would move Node and the Debian release
# underneath the agents too.
FROM node:22.23.2-bookworm-slim

# OPENCLAW_VERSION / ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROVIDER_VERSION must be bumped together
# (they are a matched core+plugin pair; see the anthropic-vertex install step
# below). 2026.9.1-beta.1 is the earliest pairing confirmed live to actually
# work end-to-end for claude-fable-5 over anthropic-vertex:
#   - openclaw@2026.7.1 (npm "latest" at time of writing): the plugin's bundled
#     @anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk@0.19.0 + gaxios/google-auth-library combo throws
#     inside its JWT/gtoken token-exchange flow -- every run fails with
#     "Failed to acquire Google OAuth credentials" (openclaw/openclaw#107341,
#     fixed upstream by #108350).
#   - openclaw@2026.7.2-beta.7 (the first release carrying that fix): a
#     separate, unrelated bug -- the plugin's "activation": {"onStartup":
#     false} manifest flag makes `oc plugins list` (and the synthetic-auth
#     provider-ref discovery it shares code with) skip anthropic-vertex
#     entirely, so it never even reaches the ADC-detecting auth hook. Confirmed
#     live: `oc plugins list` omits the plugin altogether at this version.
#   - openclaw@2026.9.1-beta.1: the discovery bug above is fixed (`oc plugins
#     list` correctly shows `stock:anthropic-vertex/dist/index.js`), and this
#     is also the first version where the new per-agent SQLite auth-profile
#     store is fully wired for anthropic-vertex -- see
#     devops_bench/agents/cli/openclaw/agent.py's
#     `_needs_anthropic_vertex_auth_profile` for the runtime-side half of this
#     fix (the config-only `gcp-vertex-credentials` marker alone is no longer
#     sufficient on this version; an explicit `oc models auth paste-api-key`
#     profile registration is required too).

# gemini-cli is pinned, not "latest": 0.58.0 is what "latest" resolved to when
# the previous image was built, so pinning it changes nothing for existing runs.
# Do not bump it without hack/check-agent-sandbox-models.sh passing on the new
# image: 0.58.0 and 0.62.0 both silently swap the requested model by default
# (see the /etc/gemini-cli/settings.json step below).

# Both agent CLIs the harness knows how to drive (devops_bench/agents/cli/):

# anthropic-vertex (Claude-on-Vertex models, e.g. claude-fable-5) is a
# separately-published plugin, not one of openclaw's own bundled "stock"
# plugins -- and `oc plugins install` registers it as a per-project USER
# plugin under ~/.openclaw/npm/projects/, a path that lives inside the very
# per-run OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR devops_bench isolates between runs (see
# agent.py's per-run oc config). A plugin registered there is invisible the
# moment the harness points oc at a fresh, empty state dir for the next run.
#
# The fix is to make it a stock plugin instead: physically place it under
# openclaw's own dist/extensions/, which oc always scans regardless of
# OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR. `npm install -g` into the SAME global prefix as
# openclaw (rather than `oc plugins install`'s isolated per-project install)
# is what makes this copy safe -- npm dedupes the "openclaw" peer dependency
# against the already-installed global package instead of vendoring its own
# node_modules/openclaw symlink, so there is no self-referencing symlink to
# trip openclaw's "Symlink escapes plugin root" guard or to recurse into
# when copied. Confirmed live: `oc plugins list` shows it as
# `stock:anthropic-vertex/dist/index.js`, enabled, under an isolated
# OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR, and its ESM entrypoint imports openclaw/plugin-sdk/*
# without error.

# Make GEMINI_MODEL mean the model that is actually called. By default
# gemini-cli rewrites model ids before calling Vertex: 0.58.0 turns every id
# ending in "flash" into gemini-3.5-flash (so GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.7-flash ran
# gemini-3.5-flash while the stream's init event still said gemini-3.7-flash),
# and 0.62.0 turns gemini-3.5-flash into gemini-3.8-flash. With
# experimental.dynamicModelConfiguration on, 0.58.0 resolves ids through its
# model table, and an id with no entry there is sent unchanged. Checked by the
# per-model token counts in the stream-json result event: gemini-3.5-flash and
# gemini-3.7-flash each bill only the requested model. System settings sit
# above user and workspace settings, so the per-run workspace settings.json the
# harness writes (mcpServers, skills) merges with this and cannot undo it.
