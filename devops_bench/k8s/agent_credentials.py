"""Mint the scoped cluster credential a sandboxed agent is given.

The sandbox's first iteration mounted the operator's own kubeconfig
credential, which on every provider this benchmark uses is cluster-admin. The
container boundary was therefore doing all the work and the RBAC boundary
none: an agent that got a shell out of the container — or simply used the
credential as intended — held the whole cluster. This module replaces that
with a ServiceAccount token minted for the run: scoped by RBAC, short-lived,
and expired by the time anyone could reuse it.

It is also what makes GKE reachable from inside a container at all. A GKE
kubeconfig authenticates through ``gke-gcloud-auth-plugin``, an ``exec:``
credential plugin needing a ``gcloud`` binary and Application Default
Credentials — both of which the container deliberately lacks, and neither of
which it can be given without handing back the cloud identity the sandbox
exists to withhold. A bearer token needs no plugin, so the rendered kubeconfig
is self-contained.

Everything here runs HOST-SIDE, under the operator's credentials, before the
agent starts. Every call is pinned to the run's own kubectl context, which is
what puts the identity in the right cluster: under vcluster the host and
virtual clusters both appear in the operator's kubeconfig, and creating the
ServiceAccount in the virtual one is what makes its token cryptographically
useless against the host.

Review rule (see ``docs/proposals/agent-sandboxing.md``): no cloud CLI —
``gcloud``, ``aws``, ``az`` — is invoked anywhere in this module. Everything
it does is plain Kubernetes API surface reached through ``kubectl``, so it
behaves identically on every provider and adds no cloud dependency to the
credential path.

#
# Every name here must be one the agent cannot write to. That is not a property

# broke, because three were empty and the fourth runs an unprivileged metrics
# scraper — but a cluster using DRA or TPUs puts a privileged, hostPath
# DaemonSet in one of them, and a fail-closed policy would deny it.
#
# Prefix matching is what that wants and is not available: a label selector
# has no prefix operator, so the binding below cannot express
# ``gke-managed-*``. Keying off the addon manager's own label is better than
# the prefixes anyway — it is the cluster stating which namespaces are its to
# run, so it covers managed namespaces that do not exist yet and names that
# follow no convention we know about.

# The admission-policy backstop, denying the escape the proposal observed:
# a privileged pod with a hostPath mount, used to read the bench checkout off
# the node's disk.
#
# PSA labels alone cannot cover this. A label is per-namespace, applied to the
# namespaces that exist when the agent starts — but the agent can create a
# namespace afterwards (``deploy-hello-app`` literally asks it to) and that
# one carries no label. A ValidatingAdmissionPolicy is cluster-wide and
# therefore proof against namespaces that do not exist yet. It also sidesteps
# a collision: ``deploy-hello-app``'s verifier asserts ``enforce=restricted``
# on its namespace, which the labeller must not clobber.
#
# ``failurePolicy: Fail`` because a control that fails open is not a control.
# The binding exempts the system namespaces by name, so a CEL evaluation error
# can cost the agent a pod but cannot wedge the cluster's own components.
#
# ``pods/ephemeralcontainers`` is matched alongside ``pods`` because it is a
# distinct subresource: a rule naming only ``pods`` matches the empty
# subresource, so without this ``kubectl debug --profile=sysadmin`` would
# attach a privileged container to an existing pod and never reach the
# ``ephemeralContainers`` validation below. ``object`` is the whole Pod on that
# subresource, so the same expressions apply unchanged.
#
# The second policy closes the other way past a name-based exemption: the agent
# can create namespaces, and several exempt names do not exist on every
# provider (``gmp-system`` on kind, ``local-path-storage`` on GKE), so it could
# simply claim one and deploy there. It is a separate policy with its own
# unselected binding because the pod policy's ``namespaceSelector`` would
# otherwise exempt the very creation being guarded. Scoping it to the agent's
# own username via ``matchConditions`` is safe here in a way it would NOT be
# for pods: a namespace is always created by whoever asked, whereas a pod may
# be created on the agent's behalf by a controller running as another identity.
#
# It covers UPDATE as well as CREATE, which the name half alone would not need
# — a name is immutable, so a namespace cannot be renamed into an exemption.
# A label can be added to one at any time, and the agent holds ``update`` and
# ``patch`` on namespaces, so exempting by ``_ADDON_MANAGER_LABEL`` without
# this would hand it a one-command escape: label a namespace it already owns
# and every pod in it stops being checked.
#
# The third policy is the one that makes the exemption safe at all, and it is
# here because a probe showed the first two were not enough. Guarding the
# *names* leaves the namespaces that already exist wide open: ``edit`` is bound
# cluster-wide, so the agent can write to ``kube-system`` on any cluster, and
# the pod policy deliberately skips it. ``kubectl run --privileged
# -n kube-system`` was therefore admitted on a cluster carrying the full policy
# set — the exact escape this module exists to deny, reachable by appending a
# flag. So the agent is denied workload writes into the exempt namespaces
# outright, which is what the "cannot write to" claim above always assumed.
#
# Scoped to the agent's username, because the cluster's own components must
# keep running: the exemption exists for kube-proxy and the CNI, not for
# whoever asks. Username scoping is sound here for the same reason it is for
# namespaces and is NOT for the pod policy — a controller never creates a pod
# in these namespaces on the agent's behalf, since the workload object it would
# have to be told to create is itself denied, at the agent's own username, one
# admission earlier.
#
# It covers every kind that can produce a pod rather than pods alone, because
# a Deployment reaches the same place with the pod created by the ReplicaSet
# controller under an identity of its own; and ``pods/exec`` alongside them,
# because ``edit`` grants exec and half the pods in ``kube-system`` are
# privileged, so a shell in one is the same escape by a longer route. It does
# not cover config: a ConfigMap in ``kube-system`` is a blast-radius question,
# not an escape, and denying those would break tasks for no boundary gain.
#
# Two bindings, because it has to select exactly what the pod policy skips and
# a ``namespaceSelector`` ANDs its expressions. "Not by name AND not by label"
# inverts to "by name OR by label", and an OR takes one binding each. Scoping
# by selector rather than testing ``namespaceObject`` in the expression also
# keeps ``failurePolicy: Fail`` cheap: a CEL error here can only block agent
# writes to namespaces where they are denied anyway, instead of every pod on
# the cluster.

    Two halves, because neither alone is enough. PSA ``baseline`` labels go on
    every namespace that exists now, which is the mechanism Kubernetes ships
    and the one an operator can read off a namespace; a
    ValidatingAdmissionPolicy backs them up cluster-wide, covering namespaces
    the agent creates *after* this runs — a label cannot, and one of the tasks
    asks the agent to create a namespace. Two further policies close the ways
    round the first one's exemptions: the agent may not claim an exempt
    namespace that does not exist yet, and may not run a workload in — or exec
    into one in — an exempt namespace that does.

    Namespaces that already carry an ``enforce`` label are left alone: a task
    may assert a specific level as part of its own verification (one asserts
    ``restricted``), and overwriting it would fail the task this control is
    supposed to protect.

    A third half, and the reason for the scan at the end: admission control
    only sees requests, so nothing here retroactively covers pods that already
    exist. The deployer runs first and some fixtures deploy privileged
    workloads on purpose — ``opa-remediation`` ships two, because remediating
    them is the task. Those pods stay, and the agent holds ``pods/exec``
    cluster-wide, so a shell into one is node root by a route this policy never
    sees. :func:`_deny_shell_into_nonconformant_pods` closes it.
