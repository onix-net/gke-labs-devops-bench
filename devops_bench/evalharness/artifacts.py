    """Copy entries created since ``before`` into the run's artifact directory.

    New files and directories (those present now but absent from ``before``) are
    copied into ``<run_dir>/generated_files/``. The destination directory is
    created only when there is at least one new entry to copy.

    Each top-level entry is copied independently, and a failure on one (for
    example a permission error on a directory a sandboxed agent's container
    left behind with restrictive mode bits) does not stop the rest from being
    attempted: ``new_entries`` iterates a ``set``, whose order is not
    guaranteed, so previously a single bad entry could silently swallow every
    entry that happened to sort after it, including ones that copied cleanly.
    That failure mode is exactly what dropped a run's Gemini session
    transcript while a `.kube` cache directory the operator could not read
    aborted collection before the transcript's own directory was ever
    attempted.

    Args:
        before: Entry names captured by :func:`snapshot_dir` prior to the run.
        run_dir: The run output directory; artifacts land under its
            ``generated_files`` subdirectory.
        source_dir: Directory the agent wrote into; defaults to the current
            working directory. The harness threads its harness-owned, per-run
            :attr:`~devops_bench.core.RunContext.workspace_path` here — the
            same directory the CLI agent wrapper executes in — so the
            artifact diff is bound to the per-task workspace, not the
            harness process's cwd.

    Returns:
        A ``(copied, failures)`` pair. ``copied`` is the names of the entries
        that were copied. ``failures`` is one ``{"name": ..., "error": ...}``
        dict per entry that raised while being copied, so the caller can
        record the collection as incomplete instead of only logging it.
