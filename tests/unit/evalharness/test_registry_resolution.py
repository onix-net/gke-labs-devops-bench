"""Registry-only agent resolution (CONVENTIONS.md §2 / harness handoff §5).

The harness must resolve agents purely through :data:`AGENTS` — there is no
``_AGENT_MODULES`` / ``_AGENT_KEYS`` dispatch table to edit when a new agent
is added. The acceptance bar is exactly: a dummy ``@AGENTS.register("dummy")``
resolves with **no harness edit**.
