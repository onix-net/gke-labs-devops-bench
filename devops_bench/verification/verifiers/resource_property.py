"""Assert a JSONPath property of one or more Kubernetes objects.

This is the general-purpose leaf verifier. Where ``pod_healthy`` and
``scaling_complete`` each answer one fixed question, this one reads any field of
any resource and compares it, which is what most task objectives actually need.

JSONPath rather than a dotted path because filter predicates make checks
order-independent. ``containers[?(@.name="web")].image`` keeps meaning the same
thing when someone injects a sidecar ahead of the app container, where
``containers[0].image`` would silently start checking the wrong one.

``eq``/``ne`` only coerce both sides to numbers when there is a concrete
numeric signal: a non-bool int/float on either side, or a Kubernetes quantity
string (a numeric stem plus a known suffix, e.g. ``"100m"`` or ``"1Gi"``) on
either side. Two plain strings compare with raw ``==`` instead, because a
version string like an image tag is not a quantity: ``"1.20" == "1.2"`` must
stay false even though ``1.20 == 1.2`` as floats. Ordering ops (``gt`` /
``gte`` / ``lt`` / ``lte``) always coerce, since they are meaningless for
anything but numbers.
